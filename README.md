# Sonar_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
I Dived into the depths of data with my Sonar Prediction project, where I leverage machine learning techniques to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signals. Explore the ocean of possibilities as I uncover patterns and insights, paving the way for enhanced underwater detection systems.
